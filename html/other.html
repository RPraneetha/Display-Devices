                    <h3>E-paper</h3><br>
                    <h4>What exactly is electronic paper?</h4>
                    <p>Electronic paper is the technology that mimics the appearance of ordinary ink on paper.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                    <p>The core of e-ink technology is small capsules filled with a clear fluid containing microscopic particles, each about as wide as a human hair.</p>
                    <p>Each electronic paper display is made up of millions of such capsules in a thin film, with the particles inside the capsules of different colors and different electric charges. Electrodes are placed above and below the capsule film. When a positive or negative electric field is applied to an individual electrode, the color particles with the corresponding charge will move either to the top or bottom of a capsule, making the surface of the e-paper display appear a certain color.</p>
                    <p>In the most basic incarnation of an e-paper screen, the particles inside an e ink capsule will be either black or white. The white particles carry a positive charge and the black particles a negative one. If the electric charge applied is negative, then the negative black ink particles will be repelled to the top of the capsule and color the surface of the display black in that spot.</p>
                    <p> Unlike a conventional flat panel display, which uses a backlight to illuminate its pixels , electronic paper reflects light like ordinary paper and is capable of holding text and images indefinitely without drawing electricity, while allowing the image to be changed later. </p>

        <h3>Projectors</h3>
        <h4>How it works</h4><br><p>Projection TVs are available in two main configurations -- front projection and rear projection. </p>
        <p>A front-projection system uses a projector and a separate screen, and it projects images onto the front of that screen. This setup looks most like what you'd find in a movie theater -- the projection unit is completely separate from the screen. The projector can be placed on a table or mounted to the ceiling. The picture looks best when displayed on a high-quality screen, but a specially painted, flat wall will work as well.</p>
        <p>Rear-projection systems look more like traditional televisions. They display images on the back of a screen rather than the front, and the projector is completely contained within the television itself. You can also set up a rear-projection system with a projector and a special screen, but the term is most often used to describe self-contained TV sets.</p>
        <p>Both configurations use tiny devices capable of making very detailed pictures. These devices can be reflective, meaning that light picks up the picture by bouncing off the device. Or, they can be transmissive, meaning that light picks up the picture by traveling through the device. Once the light picks up the picture, a lens magnifies the picture and projects it onto the screen.</p>

      <h3>Digital Light Processing</h3>
        <h4>What is it?</h4><br><p>Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a display device based on optical micro-electro-mechanical technology that uses a digital micromirror device. It was originally developed in 1987 by Dr. Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments.</p>
        <h4>How it works:</h4><p>DLP technology is based on an optical semiconductor, called a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD), which uses mirrors made of aluminum to reflect light to make the picture. The DMD is often referred to as the DLP chip. The chip can be held in the palm of your hand, yet it can contain more than 2 million mirrors each, measuring less than one-fifth the width of a human hair. The mirrors are laid out in a matrix, much like a photo mosaic, with each mirror representing one pixel.</p>
        <p>If you look closely at a DMD, you would see tiny square mirrors that reflect light, instead of the tiny photographs. From far away (or when the light is projected on the screen), you would see a picture.</p>
        <p>The number of mirrors corresponds to the resolution of the screen. DLP 1080p technology delivers more than 2 million pixels for true 1920x1080p resolution, the highest available.</p>
        <p>In addition to the mirrors, the DMD unit includes:<ul>

            <li>A CMOS DDR SRAM chip, which is a memory cell that will electrostatically cause the mirror to tilt to the on or off position, depending on its logic value (0 or 1)</li>
            <li>A heat sink</li>
            <li>An optical window, which allows light to pass through while protecting the mirrors from dust and debris</li>
            </ul></p>
