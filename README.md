# Display-Devices

This is my 6th semester Chemistry project on the different types of display devices and how they work.

I have used the following template for the project:
[Creative](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/) is a one page creative theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
